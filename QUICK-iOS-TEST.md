# Quick iOS Testing Instructions

## Your iOS project is ready! Here's how to test it:

### Immediate Steps:

1. **Download the iOS project:**
   - I've created `ios-project-ready.zip` in your workspace
   - Download this file to your Mac using Replit's download feature

2. **Open on your Mac:**
   ```bash
   unzip ios-project-ready.zip
   cd App
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```

3. **Test in Xcode:**
   - Select iPhone simulator (iPhone 15, 14, etc.)
   - Click Run ▶️ button
   - Your golf app will launch!

### What You'll See:
- App name: "Bar None Ranch Golf"
- Loading screen with golf branding
- Native iOS interface
- Camera access for photos (on physical device)

### If You Make Web Changes:
1. Build web assets: `npm run build` (when CSS issues are fixed)
2. Sync: `npx cap sync ios`
3. Download updated iOS folder
4. Re-open in Xcode

### Ready for App Store:
- Bundle ID: com.barnoneranch.golfscore
- Native plugins: Camera, Device, Filesystem
- iOS-optimized interface and icons

The remote development + local iOS testing workflow is the standard approach for hybrid app development!
