# iOS Development with Remote Replit Setup

## The Problem
You're using Cursor with SSH to connect to Replit, but iOS development requires Xcode which only runs on macOS locally.

## Solution: Download and Run Locally

### Option 1: Download iOS Project to Local Mac

1. **Download the iOS project folder from Replit:**
   ```bash
   # In your Cursor/Replit terminal, create a zip file
   zip -r ios-project.zip ios/
   ```

2. **Download the zip file to your local Mac:**
   - Use Replit's file download feature
   - Or use scp if you have direct SSH access

3. **Extract and open on your Mac:**
   ```bash
   # On your local Mac
   unzip ios-project.zip
   cd ios/App
   open App.xcworkspace
   ```

### Option 2: Clone/Sync to Local Development

1. **Set up local development environment:**
   ```bash
   # On your local Mac
   git clone [your-repo-url]  # if using git
   cd your-project
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build locally and sync:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx cap sync ios
   npx cap open ios
   ```

### Option 3: Use Replit's Download Feature

1. In Replit web interface, right-click on the `ios` folder
2. Select "Download as zip"
3. Extract on your Mac and open in Xcode

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Develop web app**: Use Cursor + SSH for web development
2. **Test iOS**: Download project to Mac, open in Xcode
3. **Update cycle**: When you make changes:
   - Build web assets: `npm run build`
   - Sync to iOS: `npx cap sync ios`
   - Download updated iOS folder to Mac
   - Test in Xcode

## Alternative: Use GitHub for Sync

Set up a repository and use it to sync between remote development and local iOS testing:

```bash
# On Replit (via Cursor)
git add .
git commit -m "Update iOS project"
git push

# On your Mac
git pull
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```
