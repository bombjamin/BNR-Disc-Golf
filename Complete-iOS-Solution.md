# Complete iOS Solution - Missing Files Issue

## The Problem
Your local repository is missing the updated iOS files I created in Replit.

## Solution: Pull Latest Changes

Run these commands in Terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/benjaminrichter/Desktop/BNR Frisbee Golf APP/BNR-Disc-Golf"

# Pull latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin main

# Navigate to iOS project
cd ios/App

# Install dependencies
pod install

# Open in Xcode
open App.xcworkspace
```

## If git pull doesn't work, try:

```bash
# Force pull latest changes
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

## Alternative: Download Fresh Project

If GitHub sync issues persist, download the updated `ios-with-cocoapods-setup.tar.gz` from Replit and extract it to replace your local iOS folder.

The missing files (capacitor.config.json, public folder, etc.) exist in the Replit version but need to be synced to your Mac.
