# Opening Your Golf App in Xcode - Step by Step

## Current Status
✅ You have downloaded `ios-project-fixed.tar.gz`  
✅ You have extracted it and found the `ios` folder  

## Next Steps (Follow Exactly)

### Step 1: Navigate to the Right Location
```bash
# Open Terminal on your Mac
# Navigate to where you extracted the file
cd /path/to/your/download/folder/ios/App
```

### Step 2: Look for These Files
In the `ios/App` folder, you should see:
- `App.xcworkspace` (THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED)
- `App.xcodeproj` (don't use this one)
- `Podfile`
- Other folders

### Step 3: Open the Workspace File
```bash
# Option A: Command line
open App.xcworkspace

# Option B: Double-click in Finder
# Double-click on App.xcworkspace (NOT App.xcodeproj)
```

### Step 4: Wait for Xcode to Load
- Xcode will open your project
- It may take a moment to index files
- You should see "Bar None Ranch Golf" as the project name

### Step 5: Select Simulator
- In Xcode toolbar, click the device selector (next to the stop button)
- Choose: iPhone 15 Pro (or any iPhone simulator)

### Step 6: Run the App
- Click the ▶️ (Play) button in Xcode toolbar
- Or press Cmd+R
- iOS Simulator will launch with your golf app

## Troubleshooting

**If App.xcworkspace doesn't exist:**
- Check you're in `ios/App/` not just `ios/`
- The full path should be: `ios/App/App.xcworkspace`

**If Xcode shows errors:**
- Try: Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
- Then: Product → Build (Cmd+B)

**If simulator doesn't start:**
- Try selecting a different iPhone model
- Restart Xcode if needed

## What You Should See
Your golf app will launch showing "Bar None Ranch Golf" with buttons for:
- Start New Game
- View Leaderboard
