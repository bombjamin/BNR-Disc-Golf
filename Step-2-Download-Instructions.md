# Step 2: Download iOS Project

## Download the iOS Project File

1. **In your Replit project**, find the file: `ios-with-cocoapods-setup.tar.gz`
2. **Right-click** on the file and select "Download"
3. **Save** it to your Desktop or Downloads folder

## Extract the File

1. **Double-click** `ios-with-cocoapods-setup.tar.gz` to extract it
2. You should now see an **`App`** folder
3. **Remember the location** of this App folder (you'll need it for Step 3)

## Ready for Step 3

Once you have the extracted `App` folder, you're ready to install the iOS dependencies.

The App folder contains:
- Your golf app's iOS project
- Xcode configuration files
- Native plugin setup
- Backend connectivity configuration
