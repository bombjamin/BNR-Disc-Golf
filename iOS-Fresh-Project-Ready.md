# iOS Project Completely Rebuilt âœ…

## What I Fixed
- Rebuilt entire iOS project from scratch
- Created all missing files (capacitor.config.json, public folder, etc.)
- Built latest web assets and synced to iOS
- Updated deployment target to iOS 15.0
- Configured all native plugins properly

## Pull Latest Changes First
```bash
cd "/Users/benjaminrichter/Desktop/BNR Frisbee Golf APP/BNR-Disc-Golf"
git pull
```

## Install Dependencies
```bash
cd ios/App
pod install
```

## Open and Run
```bash
open App.xcworkspace
```

All the missing files and configuration issues have been resolved. Your iOS app should now build and run successfully with full backend connectivity.
